This module allows to register publications that a partner can receive.

Publications can be of multiple kind: printed, electronic,
and free or paid for.

Paid publications can be linked to a contract (recurring analytic account).

For printed publications, you can setup a distribution list, in order that
one partner can have a subscription contract, but other partners actually
receive the publication. Think about organisations subscribing to
a publication and having them send out to their members.
