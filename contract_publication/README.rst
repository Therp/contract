====================
Contract Publication
====================

This module allows to register publications that a partner can receive.

Publications can be of multiple kind: printed, electronic,
and free or paid for.

Paid publications can be linked to a contract (recurring analytic account).

For printed publications, you can setup a distribution list, in order that
one partner can have a subscription contract, but other partners actually
receive the publication. Think about organisations subscribing to
a publication and having them send out to their members.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to add publications as products. Then you can
have contract lines for those publications. In the partner form you will be
able to see the publications the partner has subscribed to and the partners
actually receiving the publications.
